# School-drop-out-policy-Spanish
Design of a innovative public policy to prevent youth violence

+ The policy's goal was to reduce dropping-out rates from schools in areas highly vulnerable to violence and crime in Peru. 
+ The pilot was implemented in Lima and Trujillo, two cities with the country's highest crime-related deaths.
+ This based-on-evidence intervention was part of the Multi-Sectorial Strategy Safe Neighborhood and was approved by the Peruvian Ministry of Interior in 2019. 
+ Through it, the Peruvian government started having real-time data regarding students' assistance rates to school and the crime risk factors they faced. Once a student presented critical school indicators, risk alarms activated the Multi-Sectorial Strategy platform, and +1 local services assisted the student, depending on the issue she had.
+ I lead the technical team and policy design when working for the Vice Minister of Public Security between 2018 and 2019.
